# JuliaHungarian
Hungarian algorithm (Kuhn-Munkres) implemented in Julia

This is the first useful thing I've done in Julia. Please feel free to submit issues/PR, especially regarding performance or Julia-specific stuff as I'm new to language.

## Use
`using JuliaHungarian`

Then

`hungarian([1 2 3; 2 4 6; 3 6 9])`;
